# Portals

## Brief history of the WebDevelopment and UX

In the beginning the web was a thing serving the purpose of showing us the world trough a "Portal" a tool used usualy to share in a simple format "papers" of someone else or for us to show our "papers" to the world, here we are talking about the age where the UX/WI were close to non-existent terms and only 'power users' were the ones able tow wield the power of the web (myself not included :D).

As time passed the web started to grow and things like CSS/JS started to appear in this so called "Portal"-s  things were simple and good. The users were able to receive data, interact with it and send it back inside. The developers at that time the developers were living quite a happy live, where there tasks were to add some color to a button, a different font to a pice text and so on. Keep in mind that I'm saying developers as whole, because at that point of time the need of specialist know as FE dev non existent.

Time went on, the web kept on growing and so were the user expectation from the so called  "Portals"-s, different creatures started to run in the web in order to meet those ever growing user requirements, one of those things which is still big thing on the web was the MVC pattern, with which the developers were able to describe more complex stuff and enable the users to interact with data in more meaningful ways. With the help of this pattern devs were able to separate the UI logic in separate entities and apply to those entities more complex rendering logic.

Around this time something unheard until this moment started to be felt by the companies providing/building software, the thing called competition, which was and is the main enging for creating new technologies and patterns in order to solve new problems.

So what does competition mean in the context of the discussed topic, whenever you have two solutions for the same problem, which are with similar price and functionality the user usually picks the more shiny one. This led to the boom of FE development where not only the "flshiness" was important but also the speed of rendering first paint on all kinds of device trough all kind of networks, patterns for managing and further developing huge projects, while at the same time keeping this bundule of code in a working state across all the possible browsers out there. 


## The problem: Showing stuff when and where I need them


#### Stage 1

Web development was always about showing things to a end user in particular order and at particular place

Single Page Applications (SPAs) offer nice transitions but come at the cost of higher complexity to build. Multi-page Applications (MPAs) are much easier to build, but you end up with blank screens between pages.
