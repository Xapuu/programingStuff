# What is open source

"The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible."
 -- [openSource.com][1]

## Open source principles
 * Transparency
    All information (about the OS project) should be transparent and easily accessible, in order for the OS project consumers to be able to do their best at their work and also to be able to extend, the ideas of the project, by modifying/extending/optimizing the already existing ideas/code/project.

 * Collaboration
    There should be a process, enforcing some kind of standard, enabling the existing consumers of the OS project/stakeholders, to be able to enhance the project. By having this kind of process all stakeholders have means to tackle problems together, that are unsolvable by one person alone (or on a level of single organization)

 * Release early and often
    An iterative release approach is recommended, this approach gives the collaborators the opportunity to experiment with new stuff, which leads to new discoveries, better solutions or in other words "The more you do, the more you learn, the better you are"

 * Meritocracy
    Although the "open source" is open to all ideas and contributors, only best ideas and solutions are those that are included, respectively the best projects are the ones that survive and continue to grow

 * Community
    The open source projects are based on varying communities united around a common purpous, where the common community goals supersede the individual interests and agendas

# Open source in terms of code

## Open source & Close source

'Open source software' is usually a free piece of code, following the previously mentioned principle, open to the public for usage, modification and extension, which usage is bounded by some kind of license.

On the other hand  'Closed source software' is software which uses closely guarded code, accessible only by the code owners, for modifications and extensions.

### Comparison
* Pricing:
     * The open source projects are free of charge.
     * The closed source projects are usually paid projects, which price depends on the complexity of the software and other market factors, which are not focused by the current topic.
* Security
  
  * As the open source project are available to the public, for modification, fixing, and extensions, usually security related issues are easier to be found and fixed quickly after that, as this issues are usually tackled not only by the developers that maintain the project, but also by the stakeholders affected by the issue, that have willingness or the need to resolve it. The other side of the coin is that malicious developers, which have access to the source code might try to exploit such issues in ways, that may affected this project's users in negative way.
  * Closed source project are more secured because of their 'closely guarded source', that makes finding exploits in their software harder, but on the other hand those companies might be slower to fix known issues or find unknown ones, as only the vendor is able to access, modify and apply fixes to the source code.

* Quality of support
* 
    * Open source software projects usually in terms of support, leave the consumers on their own. The support comes from the project's documentation, forums, or paid developer experts/consultant.
    * Closed source projects typicaly provide top-notch support, as usually the cost paid for the product includes an option to contact support center and get their problems resolved.

* Usability
 
    * Open source projects are usually created from developers for developers or technical people, which occasionally leads to that, that segments of the software documentation is incomplete, different segments are written inconsitent style. Usually the reason for those flaws is thanks to the big variety of contributors, the lack of technical writers involved in those projects or the lack of strict proceses and rules in the process of introducing new features, fixes or extensions to the source of the project. The merits of using open source software, lie in the possibility of extending the source, to meet your project specific requirements,  also the popular open source projects, usually have big community which is active on all kind of social networks and is taking care of most of the previously mentioned, usability related problems.
    * With closed source projects, where usually the user pays for the product, it is almost for sure, that the vendor is providing all of the required documentation, examples and support, for the customer to be able to use the software. The tradeoff when using this kind of software is that when you have specific requirements, which are not implemented by the product, you are not able to extend the product in such way that it meets your requirements.

# Open source as part of successful business

# How does it help us

# How to contribute

# How to become amazing contributor 
 * Have a real problem to solve, business need, or some type of commercially-driven motivation.
 * Understand the goals of the project and make sure your contribution is in line with them.
 * Submit complete patches that implement full features. Include any test information and documentation.
 * Play by the rules of the project that you're contributing to.
 * Be humble. Never add your name to the list of contributors yourselfâ€”the project leader should do so, if she or he values your work.
 * Have low expectations. Learn to accept rejection.
 * Persevere. Improve upon comments and keep sending updates.
 * Be honest and vocal about your available time and skills.
 * Be a doer, not a talker or a troll.
 * Finish what you started, don't give up.
