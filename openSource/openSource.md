# What is open source

"The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible."
-- [openSource.com][1]

## Open source philosophy principles

- Transparency
  All information (about the OS project) should be transparent and easily accessible, in order for the OS project consumers to be able to do their best at their work and also to be able to extend, the ideas of the project, by modifying/extending/optimizing the already existing ideas/code/project.

- Collaboration
  There should be a process, enforcing some kind of standard, enabling the existing consumers of the OS project/stakeholders, to be able to enhance the project. By having this kind of process, all stakeholders have means to tackle the common problems together, problems which are unsolvable by a single person (or inside of single organization)

- Release early and often
  An iterative release approach is recommended, this approach allows the collaborators to experiment with new stuff, which leads to discoveries, better solutions or in other words "The more you do, the more you learn, the better you are"

- Meritocracy
  Although the "open source" is open to all ideas and contributors, only best ideas and solutions are those that are included, respectively the best projects are the ones that survive and continue to grow

- Community
  The open source projects are based on varying communities united around a common purpose, where the common goals supersede the individual interests and agendas

## Brief history

## Open source definition

## Open & Close source

'Open source software' is usually a free piece of code, following the previously mentioned principles, open to the public, under a license agreement, that allows usage, modification, and extension.

On the other hand 'Closed source software' is software that uses closely guarded code, accessible only by the code owners.

### Comparison

- Pricing:

  - The open source projects are free of charge, there are still organizations that are making their living from OSS and we will look further in this topic later on.
  - The closed source projects are usually paid projects, the price depends on the complexity of the software and other market factors, which will not be further discussed.

- Security

  - As the "source" of "Open Source Projects" is freely and easily accessible by design, usually, security-related issues are easier to be spotted, as any consumer is free to inspect the code and find vulnerabilities. The periods for fixing those issues are also shorter, as these issues are usually tackled not only by the maintainers of the project but also by the affected stakeholders, which have the willingness or the urge to resolve the issue.

    The flip side of the coin is the malicious developers, that have access to the source code and might try to exploit such issues in ways, that may affect negatively the project consumers.

  - Closed source projects are more secured because of their 'closely guarded source', this makes the process of finding exploits harder, but this also takes it's toll as most likely those types of projects will resolve security issues in a slower manner (compared to the OSS), usually because of the limited resources available to the vendor.

- Quality of support

  - In terms of support OSS projects usually, leave the consumers on their own. The support comes from the project's documentation, forums, or paid developer experts/consultant.
  - Closed source projects typically provide top-notch support, the cost paid for the product includes an option to contact the support center and get their problems resolved.

- Usability

  - OSS projects are usually created from developers for developers or technical people, which occasionally leads to cases, where segments of the software documentation are incomplete, different segments are written in inconsistent style. The most common reason behind those flaws is the big variety of contributors, the lack of technical writers involved in those projects or the lack of strict processes and rules in the process of introducing new features, fixes or extensions to the `source` of the project. The merits of using open source software, lie in the possibilities of extending the `source`, to meet your project-specific requirements, another benefit of the popular open source projects, is that they most likely have big community, which is active on all kind of social networks and is willingly helping free of charge, which solves most of the previously mentioned, usability related problems.
  - With closed source projects, where the users are customers paying for a useable product, it is a given, that the vendor is providing all required documentation, examples and support, for their customers to be able to use the purchased software.

    The tradeoff when using this kind of software, is that when you have specific requirements, which are not implemented by the purchased product, usually you are not able to extend the product, in such ways that it meets your requirements.

## How does open source companies make money

As we are talking about open source and how cool it is, maybe in many of you arises the question how sustainable are those open-source stuff and as everything else at some point probably those projects need some cash to keep them up and kicking, so from where is this cash coming and can an organization live by creating open source projects.

1 Support

Some open source projects are making their earnings by providing support and on sight paid training to the consumers of the software. For example if you are company that wants to adopt some open software technology that is to hard to be adopted or the cost to train specialists from zero on their own is to high, for the business is more preferable to pay some experienced specialists to implement the initial setups (installations and etc) and train some specialist, showing them their know-how.

Example: Apache’s Hadoop which is free to use software, that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets, but is too complex for initial adoption.

2 Hosting

Some open source companies provide hosting services for their products, which are paid. A good example for this kind of company is mongoDB, on top of support (the first type of OS income method) they also provide hosting services for their database in the form of a product called Atlas.

3 Open-core

This concept lies around the strategy that only part of the software whole software `The Core` is free and the rest of the functionality is paid.

For example we can take "agGrid" which is a UI library, and it's `core` functionality is under "MIT" license, which means that the users can free of charge  use those core components. There is also a `non-core` or in other words paid set of components, which can be purchesd.

4 Advertisement partners

Some projects are earning money for their causes, by allowing some kind of advertisement on their project pages, a good example is [`VueJs`][4] which is project primary funded by sponsors, which are listed in projects related pages.

5 Donations/ Pay what you want

As the name here the consumers have the opportunity to become patrons of an open source project trough one time donations or through regular payments. Open source projects that function in this category are Vim and webpack

# Basics

## Players

To understand the role of a `Contributor`, we must take a quick review of all primary roles involved in an open source project

Typically there are five categories of people:

- Author: The person or people who had created the project, the first contributors
- Owner: The person or people who have the administrative authority over the project, those people might not include the original authors, as in some cases the original authors might leave the project and transfer the ownership to other community members.
- Maintainers: Usually they are core members of the OS project, or a distinctive and recognized members of the project's community. They are the people responsible for managing the organizational aspects of the project and have some authority over the project.
- Contributors: Anyone that at some point had contributed to the project
- Community Members: The project stakeholder, or in other words the people that are using the project.

Those are the main categories of people usually seen in an OS project, but depending on the project there might be additional roles and titles.

## How does it help us

- Pure satisfaction

Something specific about professionals from all kind spheres is that at some point, the so called professionals strive to share their knowledge and in the case of software development this is quite easy, just contribute to open source projects, help other people to tackle their problems, by sharing your knowledge and helping out in the process

- Self-improvement and career growth

By tackling other people's problems, usually, the one contributing practice and extends his skills, by gaining new knowledge trough solving problems, that he had not hit until this moment. Also by leaving your mark in the open source world, you are bound to communicate with a lot of professionals from the community, which can further help with your career growth.  
If (if you are interested in open source) you continuously contribute to open source project, their will chances for your recognition as professional, which can lead to job opportunities and so on, their many successful career stories started from open source projects, if you don't believe me just google it.

## What is contributing

Usually, when people are talking about open source projects and contributions, there is a common misunderstanding that all contributions are related to contributing code to the source project. Let's check out how and what we can contribute to help out our favorite open source projects.

- Help out with the docs

One of the easiest ways to contribute to a project is to help out with the documentation, as a project grows and changes the risk of having incomplete documentation or one in which there are some typos, grows exponentially. So a good way to help out the core team is to create PR-s containing typo-fixes, extension, creation or clarification of examples.

- Review others PR-s

As the source of the OS projects and all PR-s are open for review, from the community, a great way to involve yourself is some project is to review the projects PR or issues and give your feedback. For example you might help the community to define an existing issue in a better way, help someone with their PR, or just appreciate and rise the heat around some cool PR in order or it to be integrated faster in the `master/release` project branch.

- Help with the administration

With the growth of the project, usually if unmaintained the issue tracker might get useless. Issues are stacking one upon another, and at some point, the project is bound to have some duplicate issues, which can lead to double work effort (if for example two people are fixing two different issues, referring to the same problem). So in order to maintain these projects, you might help by adding appropriate flags and referring those types of duplicating issues.

- Help with the design

Some people are more artistic than others or have skillet that allows them to create great designs graphics and so on, so if you are one of those people in the OS world there are always possibilities for improving existing or creating new art-content that can be useful for a project, this can be some graphics with examples, higher-quality images of the existing logos and so-on.

- Help the community

There is also the possibility to contribute to the project, by creating project-related content, for example you can create tutorials, help people on forums/ chats, participate in conferences, help to organize meetUps related to the projects that you like.

- Just code

There is always the possibility to grab some issues and just fix it, with the help of the community :)

# Open source in terms of code

Enough marketing let's talk about how contributions are done IRL

## Know your stack

First thing first the enthusiasm is a must, but you must be aware of your knowledge and capabilities in order to find out in what kind of projects you can get involve and how you can fit in the contributor's community. For example if you are knowledgeable C++, you will be very well received in projects like [node][5] under the issue [c++][6] label, if you have good understanding of [ngrx][7] and are good with photoshop you might be able to part take in resolving the following [issue][8]. If you don't feel confident about writing code but are passionate about js, you can always proofread some open source books like [You Dont'Know JS series][9] or [Functional Light js][10] created by [getify][11].

## Get to know the project

After finding a project that you are passionate about, it's a must to get familiar with the project's rules. Doing this is a trivial task, go to the project repository and read the `README.md` this file usually holds detailed info about how to get started. There is a high probability that you will also be able to find a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files that hold all the rules that your PR must align to for them to be accepted.

Keep in mind that as a contributor you are the one obligated to follow the project's rules and not the other way around, so don't get frustrated if your PR-s are rejected at first, if this happens, as the OS community is very welcoming to new contributors, a more experienced contributor or maintainer will probably provide you with guidance to fix the issues around your PR. If you think that the project's workflows are wrong, you can also create PR to the mentioned above rule sets.

## Find an issue

As mentioned before, a must for any OS project is a system for issues tracking and collaboration, if we take for example the [GitHub][12] platform, each project has an issue section where you can log a new issue or find existing ones. The more developed project has a rich set of labels describing the difficulty or the subject of an issue, by using those labels you can filter issues in such way, that you can find the ones falling in your stillest.

If you don't have a favorite project, or just want to contribute something for the fun, but don't know precisely where you can apply your knowledge, you can use [issuehub.io][13] to find an issue that picks your interest.

## Earn cash

As an open source contributor, there is also the opportunity to earn some cash through platforms like [issuehunt.io][14], which is a platform that provides bounty submissions related to Github issues.

# How to become an amazing contributor

- Have a real problem to solve, business needs, or some type of commercially-driven motivation.
- Understand the goals of the project and make sure your contribution is in line with them.
- Submit complete patches that implement full features. Include any test information and documentation.
- Play by the rules of the project that you're contributing to.
- Be humble. Never add your name to the list of contributors yourself—the project leader should do so if she or he values your work.
- Have low expectations. Learn to accept rejection.
- Persevere. Improve upon comments and keep sending updates.
- Be honest and vocal about your available time and skills.
- Be a doer, not a talker or a troll.
- Finish what you started, don't give up.
- These rules were listed by `Daniel Doubrovkine` at [opensource.com][2]
