# What is open source

"The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible."
-- [openSource.com][1]

## Open source principles

- Transparency
  All information (about the OS project) should be transparent and easily accessible, in order for the OS project consumers to be able to do their best at their work and also to be able to extend, the ideas of the project, by modifying/extending/optimizing the already existing ideas/code/project.

- Collaboration
  There should be a process, enforcing some kind of standard, enabling the existing consumers of the OS project/stakeholders, to be able to enhance the project. By having this kind of process all stakeholders have means to tackle problems together, that are unsolvable by one person alone (or on a level of single organization)

- Release early and often
  An iterative release approach is recommended, this approach gives the collaborators the opportunity to experiment with new stuff, which leads to new discoveries, better solutions or in other words "The more you do, the more you learn, the better you are"

- Meritocracy
  Although the "open source" is open to all ideas and contributors, only best ideas and solutions are those that are included, respectively the best projects are the ones that survive and continue to grow

- Community
  The open source projects are based on varying communities united around a common purpous, where the common community goals supersede the individual interests and agendas

## Open source & Close source

'Open source software' is usually a free piece of code, following the previously mentioned principle, open to the public for usage, modification and extension, which usage is bounded by some kind of license.

On the other hand 'Closed source software' is software which uses closely guarded code, accessible only by the code owners, for modifications and extensions.

### Comparison

- Pricing:
  - The open source projects are free of charge.
  - The closed source projects are usually paid projects, which price depends on the complexity of the software and other market factors, which are not focused by the current topic.
- Security

  - As the open source project are available to the public, for modification, fixing, and extensions, usually security related issues are easier to be found and fixed quickly after that, as this issues are usually tackled not only by the developers that maintain the project, but also by the stakeholders affected by the issue, that have willingness or the need to resolve it. The other side of the coin is that malicious developers, which have access to the source code might try to exploit such issues in ways, that may affected this project's users in negative way.
  - Closed source project are more secured because of their 'closely guarded source', that makes finding exploits in their software harder, but on the other hand those companies might be slower to fix known issues or find unknown ones, as only the vendor is able to access, modify and apply fixes to the source code.

- Quality of support
- - Open source software projects usually in terms of support, leave the consumers on their own. The support comes from the project's documentation, forums, or paid developer experts/consultant.
  - Closed source projects typicaly provide top-notch support, as usually the cost paid for the product includes an option to contact support center and get their problems resolved.

- Usability

  - Open source projects are usually created from developers for developers or technical people, which occasionally leads to that, that segments of the software documentation is incomplete, different segments are written inconsitent style. Usually the reason for those flaws is thanks to the big variety of contributors, the lack of technical writers involved in those projects or the lack of strict proceses and rules in the process of introducing new features, fixes or extensions to the source of the project. The merits of using open source software, lie in the possibility of extending the source, to meet your project specific requirements, also the popular open source projects, usually have big community which is active on all kind of social networks and is taking care of most of the previously mentioned, usability related problems.
  - With closed source projects, where usually the user pays for the product, it is almost for sure, that the vendor is providing all of the required documentation, examples and support, for the customer to be able to use the software. The tradeoff when using this kind of software is that when you have specific requirements, which are not implemented by the product, you are not able to extend the product in such way that it meets your requirements.

## How does open source companies make money

As we are talking about open source and how cool it is, maybe in many of you arises the question how sustainable are those open-source stuff and as everything else at some point probably those projects need some cash to keep them up and kicking, so from where is this cash coming and can an organization live by creating open source projects.

1 Support

Some open source project are making their earnings by providing support and on sight paid trainings to the consumers of the software. Fot example if you are company that wants to adopt some open software technology that is to hard to be adopted or the cost to train specialists from zero on their own is to high, for the business is more preferable to pay some experienced specialists to implement the initial setups (installations and etc) and train some specialist, showing them their know-how.

Example: Apacheâ€™s Hadoop which is free to use, but is too complex for initial adoption, which is a software designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

2 Hosting

Some open source companies provide hosting services for their products, which are paid. Good example for this kind of company is mongoDB, on top of support (the first type of OS income method) they also provide hosting services for their database in the form of product called Atlas.

3 Open-core

This concept lies around the strategy that only part of the software whole software `The Core` is free and the rest of the functionality is paid.

For example if you have some kind UI library, and let's say it's core functionality is to have some tables and stuff, which are free of charge for all users and there is a `non-core` or in other words paid set of components for data visualization, that can be used as complimentary components to the core version.

4 Advertisement partners

Some projects are earning money for their causes, by allowing some kind of advertisement on their project pages, good example is [`VueJs`][4] which is project primary funded by sponsors, which are listed in projects related pages.

5 Donations/ Pay what you want

As the name here the consumers have the opportunity to become patrons of an open source project trough one time donations or trough regular payments. Open source projects that function in this category are Vim and webpack

# How to contribute

## Players

In order to understand the role of a `Contributor` , we must take a quick of all the usual suspects, involved in an open source project

Typically there are five categories of people:

- Author: The person or people which had created the project, the first contributors
- Owner: The person or people who has the administrative authority over the project, those people might not include the original authors, as in some cases the original authors might leave the project and transfer the ownership to other community members.
- Maintainers: Usually they are core members of the OS project, or a distinctive and recognized members of the project's community. They are the people responsible for managing the organizational aspects of the project, and have some authority over the project.
- Contributors: Anyone that at some point had contributed to the project
- Community Members: The project stake holder, or in other words the people that are using the project.

This are the main categories of people usually seen in an OS project, but depending on the project there might be addition roles and titles.

## How does it help us

- Pure satisfaction

Something specific about professionals from all kind spheres is that at some point, the so called professionals strive to share their knowledge and in the case of software development this is quite easy, just contribute to open source projects, help other people to tackle their problems, by sharing your knowledge and helping out in the process

- Self improvement and career growth

By tackling other people problems, usually the one contributing practice and extends his skills, by gaining new knowledge trough solving problems, that he had not hit until this moment. Also by leaving your mark in the open source world, you are bound to communicate with a lot of professionals form the community, which can further help with your career growth.  
If (if you are interested in open source) you continuously contribute to open source project, their will chances for your recognition as professional, which can lead to job opportunities and so on, their many success career stories started from open source projects, if you don't believe me just google it.

## What is contributing

Usually when people are talking about open source projects and contributions, there is the common misunderstanding that all contributions are related to contributing code to the source project. Let's check out how and what we can contribute to help out our favorite open source projects.

- Help out with the docs

One of the easiest ways to contribute to a project is to help out with the documentation, as a project grows and changes the risk of having incomplete documentation or one in which there are some typos grows exponentially. So a good way to help out the core team is to create PR-s containing typo-fixes, extension, creation or clarification of examples.

- Review others PR-s

As the source of the OS projects and all PR-s are open for review, from the community, a great way to involve yourself is some project is to review the projects PR or issues and give your feedback. For example you might help the community to define an existing issue in a better way, help someone with their PR, or just appreciate and rise the heat around some cool PR in order or it to be integrated faster in the `master/release` project branch.

- Help with the administration

With the growth of the project, usually if unmaintained the issue tracker might get useless. Issues are stacking one on upon another, and at some point the project is bound to have some duplicate issues, which can lead to double work effort (if for example two people are fixing two different issues, referring one and the same problem). So in order to maintain this the projects you might help by adding appropriate flags and referring those type of duplicating issues.

- Help with the design

Some people are more artistic than others or have skillet that allows them to create great designs graphics and so on, so if you are one of those people in the OS world there are always possibilities for improving existing or creating new art-content that can be useful for a project, this can be some graphics with examples, higher-quality images of the existing logos and so-on.

- Help the community

There is also the possibility to contribute to the project, by creating project related content, for example you can create tutorials, help people on forums/ chats, participate in conferences, help organizing meetUps related to the projects that you like.

- Just code

There is always the possibility to grab some issues and just fix it, with the help of the community :)

# Open source in terms of code

# How to become amazing contributor

- Have a real problem to solve, business need, or some type of commercially-driven motivation.
- Understand the goals of the project and make sure your contribution is in line with them.
- Submit complete patches that implement full features. Include any test information and documentation.
- Play by the rules of the project that you're contributing to.
- Be humble. Never add your name to the list of contributors yourselfâ€”the project leader should do so, if she or he values your work.
- Have low expectations. Learn to accept rejection.
- Persevere. Improve upon comments and keep sending updates.
- Be honest and vocal about your available time and skills.
- Be a doer, not a talker or a troll.
- Finish what you started, don't give up.

# OpenSource projects

- games
- frameworks
- OS - Linux (see others)

# OpenSource licenses

# Take away

We talked a lot about open source and stuff, but why is it powerful, if i can interpreter a famous Bulgarian saying "The unity creates strength" and open source is all about uniting different people under the same banners, so guys embrace and be part of the united open source community, because only united we are truly powerful!
